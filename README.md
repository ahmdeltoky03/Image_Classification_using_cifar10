## Description About Notebook and Dataset


## About Dataset
The `CIFAR-10 dataset` is widely used for `image classification` tasks. It contains `60,000 images` categorized into `10 classes`, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. For more details, visit the dataset page on Kaggle: [click here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10/).

## About Notebook
This repo contains a deep learning project implementing an image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images into 10 distinct categories.


## Features
